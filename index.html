				<p class="title">Mining’s Impact on the Environment</p>
				<p class="text">It’s no surprise that mining has a large impact on the environment in many different ways. It pollutes oxygen and water, harms wildlife and their habitats, and can cause permanent damage to natural landscapes. Water can be polluted by acid rock drainage, which is formed by sulphide and minerals found in waste rock and ore being exposed to oxygen and water, which reacts by releasing sulphuric acid and metal oxides into streams. More than 40% of streams in western watersheds have been contaminated by ARD. Additionally, fossil fuels used in mines as the primary mining fuel, emit many greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, being a major cause of global warming.</p>

				<p class="title">What’s Being Done</p>
				<p class="text">While mining is environmentally damaging, it’s not all bad. Many companies are committing to lowering the negative impacts of mining they produce. For example, some are reducing the current energy use by employing efficient energy utilization plans that can cut the amount of energy used without decreasing productivity. Plus, 18% of mines are currently using reusable energy. Automated ventilation systems are also being installed in an underground mine in Sudbury. This has resulted in a reduction of almost 40% of the energy consumption, decreased greenhouse gas emissions, and saved costs of up to $4 million per year.</p>

				<p class="title">Alternative Mining Method</p>
				<p class="text">A valuable step in committing to green mining would be changing how mines operate completely. Situ mining is a mining method in which material is ejected from the ground using special pumps. This method is the most environmentally friendly alternative to open-pit and underground mining. It’s far cheaper, safer for workers and surrounding communities, and it produces minimal noise, dust, and greenhouse gases. However, the geology has to be specific and few materials can be extracted as opposed to other methods.</p>

				<p class="title">Fixing Past Mistakes</p>
				<p class="text">Mining has done a lot of permanent damage to our environment, but efforts are being made to fix what we can. 10% of mining costs come from electricity; this number can be lowered by operating battery-powered equipment and promoting bio-energy production. Also, alternative energy sources can be used, like wind and solar. The mining industry uses 40% of Earth’s water supply; therefore mines should reduce water needs and install a water treatment device for water reuse. We can also work towards shutting down illegal and unregulated mines, as well as cleaning up the sites of shut-down mines. According to the Nation Mining Association, U.S mining companies have reclaimed over 2.8 million acres of land.</p>

				<p class="title">Modern Techniques</p>
				<p class="text">Many safer and far more sustainable mining techniques have also been implemented. Sometimes, metals being mined end up in the wastes. Repressing these wastes can result in more usable material. Dust is also a big problem in mines, for both the workers and the environment. Dust suppression has been a hot topic in the industry, but there is a solution. It can be reduced by pre-wetting the areas with powerful sprinklers and removing dust in the air using mist cannons. We can also lessen the amount of methane gas in mines by pulling it out with a powerful fan, turning it into carbon dioxide and water vapour, and releasing it into the atmosphere. </p>

				<p class="title">What’s Next?</p>
				<p class="text">We’ve done a lot to lessen the environmental footprint mining produces, but there’s still more change needed. If we can reduce energy consumption, we can lessen the amount of greenhouse gas emissions and extend the life of fossil fuel reserves, lowering operation costs. We could reduce the overall size of the mining area, minimizing waste produced and stored, protecting endangered plants, and planning mines around infrastructure. An important step in sustainability is reusing materials. We can repurpose things such as mine waste into roads and building for example.</p>

				<p class="title">Mining and the economy</p>
				<p class="text">Mining is no cheap industry. For example, open-pit mining costs about 500 million USD, and underground mining costs even more. And the cheaper mining method still costs about 25-35 million USD. Many factors go into the cost of mining, such as staff, labour, equipment, processing, and many more. While mining does cost a lot, it also contributes a lot to the economy. In 2019, the mining industry contributed 5% of Canada’s GDP. It also accounts for many Canadian jobs, with one in every 26 jobs directly or indirectly working in the mining industry.</p>
